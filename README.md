# Asynchronous FIFO Memory Module

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of an asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory module. The module is designed to efficiently manage data transfer between asynchronous clock domains.

## Overview

The asynchronous FIFO memory module is a hardware component that allows for reliable data transfer between two clock domains with potentially different clock frequencies. It ensures proper synchronization and data integrity during read and write operations.

## Features

- Asynchronous data transfer between clock domains.
- Implements a First-In-First-Out memory structure.
- Supports simultaneous read and write operations.
- Ensures data integrity and synchronization.
